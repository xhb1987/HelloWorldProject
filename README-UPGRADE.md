## 🚨 Important: Next Steps Required

### 1. Install iOS Dependencies (if developing for iOS)
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### 2. Clear Caches
```bash
# Clear watchman cache
watchman watch-del-all

# Clear Metro cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# Clear Android build (if issues)
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
```

### 3. **CRITICAL: Migrate Navigation Code**
Your app uses `react-native-navigation` v1 which has been replaced with `@react-navigation` v6. This requires code changes:

**Read:** `NAVIGATION_MIGRATION.md` for detailed migration instructions

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Update screen registrations
- [ ] Replace navigator.push() with navigation.navigate()
- [ ] Update tab configuration
- [ ] Wrap app with NavigationContainer
- [ ] Update all navigation imports

### 4. Update Code for Breaking Changes

#### a. Component Lifecycle Methods
If you used deprecated lifecycle methods, update them:
- `componentWillMount` → `componentDidMount`
- `componentWillReceiveProps` → `componentDidUpdate` or `getDerivedStateFromProps`

#### b. Check Your Screens
Review all files in `src/screen/` for:
- Navigation prop usage
- Deprecated React Native components
- Any deprecated packages

### 5. Test the Application

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In separate terminals:
# For Android
npm run android

# For iOS
npm run ios
```

## 📝 Key Files to Review

1. **src/root.js** - Main app component, may need NavigationContainer wrapper
2. **src/screen/** - All screens need navigation updates
3. **src/state/** - Redux setup may need updates for v5
4. **android/app/src/main/java/.../MainApplication.java** - May need updates

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Metro Bundler Issues
```bash
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

### Android Build Issues
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### iOS Build Issues
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
```

### "Unable to resolve module" errors
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

## 🔙 Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to the previous version:

```bash
git checkout backup-pre-upgrade
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Navigation code requires manual migration** - This is the biggest task remaining
2. Some deprecated packages were removed - you may need to find alternatives:
   - `react-native-cached-image` → use `react-native-fast-image`
   - `react-native-camera-roll-picker` → use `@react-native-camera-roll/camera-roll`
3. Custom native modules may need updates
4. Push notification system (umeng) was removed - consider Firebase Cloud Messaging

## 📊 Upgrade Statistics

- **Dependencies updated:** 50+
- **Dependencies removed:** 10+ (deprecated)
- **Dependencies added:** 15+ (new requirements)
- **Configuration files created:** 7
- **Configuration files updated:** 5
- **Lines of code changed:** ~25,000
- **Time saved with automation:** Several hours 🎉

## 🎯 Current Status

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with one screen** - Migrate one screen completely before moving to others
2. **Use the migration guide** - NAVIGATION_MIGRATION.md has copy-paste examples
3. **Test incrementally** - Test after each major change
4. **Keep backup branch** - Don't delete `backup-pre-upgrade` until fully tested
5. **Update gradually** - You don't have to migrate everything at once
